## Treasure Hunter Game

This repo is for a game I made for my subject "Programming for Video Games" at uni. The game's
called "Treasure Hunter", and is made in Godot.

The game features a start screen. You enter a little park where you have to find little
treasure chests and open them by pressing 'F'. Once 5 chests are opened or the timer runs out,
the game is over and you're thrown in the main menu again.

This game was a way for me to learn Godot, creating character and proper camera movement,
making a UI, features such as Stamina, etc.
